# Introduction to Computational Neuroscience

## Understanding Our Universe
- **Universe Misconception:** Traditional view vs. the real universe inside our skull.
- **Brain Functionality:** The brain, a three-pound mass of tissue, allows us to perceive the world and universe, think, feel, act, and be human. It enables speech, listening, and even the decision to skip boring parts of a lecture.

## Course Overview
This course will explore how to understand the brain using computational models. We will cover three types of computational models:

1. **Descriptive Models**
   - **Objective:** Quantify how neurons respond to external stimuli.
   - **Neural Encoding Model:** Describes neuron responses quantitatively.
   - **Decoding:** Extract information from recorded neurons to control devices like prosthetic hands. Important for brain-computer interfacing and neural prosthetics.

2. **Mechanistic Models**
   - **Objective:** Simulate the behavior of single neurons or neuron networks on a computer.
   - **Example:** Human Brain Project led by Henry Markram in Europe, aiming to simulate large networks or the entire brain.

3. **Interpretive (Normative) Models**
   - **Objective:** Understand why brain circuits operate as they do.
   - **Focus:** Extract computational principles underlying brain circuit functions.

## Recommended Textbooks
1. **Theoretical Neuroscience** by Peter Dayan and Larry Abbott
   - Standard textbook in the field.
2. **Tutorial on Neural Systems Modelling** by Thomas Anastasio
   - Includes MATLAB code useful for exploring concepts and computations.

## Course Goals
By the end of the course, you should be able to:
1. **Quantitative Description:** Describe what biological neurons or networks are doing using experimental data.
2. **Simulation:** Simulate neuron or network behavior on a computer.
3. **Computational Principles:** Formulate principles to explain the operation of certain neurons or networks.
